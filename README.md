# online-alarm-clock
This is my private project, developed in my spare time. The aim is to create a useful tool that allows users to set alarms, customize alarm sounds, and includes a timer and stopwatch functionality. Despite being a personal endeavor, I hope that this application can be beneficial to others. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
